# Status on the 18th of May 2022

## What currently works

* Overview of features in Jupyter notebooks
* Feedback control of cylinder and pinball flows (both `gym.Env` and solver interfaces)
* Newton-Krylov fixed point solver
* Time integration with a projection scheme
* Direct and adjoint global stability analysis with SLEPc
* Conversion to discrete-time LTI system
* Interface to Modred for modal analysis
* Adjoint-based optimization with PyAdjoint
* Basic test suite


## What doesn't work (yet)

* Adjoint operator construction in discrete time
* LQR control for cylinder (control design works, but blows up in DNS)


## What needs to be tested?

* Cavity flow
